Team Two (Theme = CommentSense) submission 

The code, uploaded as ML1_LorealFinalSubmission, is in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format, which requires the Jupyter Notebook environment to run.

However, the code has a modular structure and can be extracted to run as a single Python script.

Specifically, the final module—the Dashboard/Interactive module—can be executed independently, using only the Sentiment_Relevancy.csv and videos_categorised.csv files as input.
